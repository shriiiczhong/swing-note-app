# SST Demo Notes App [![Seed Status](https://api.seed.run/serverless-stack/demo-notes-app/stages/prod/build_badge)](https://console.seed.run/serverless-stack/demo-notes-app)

The [SST Guide](https://sst.dev/guide) is a comprehensive open source tutorial for building and deploying full-stack apps using serverless and React on AWS.

We create a note taking app from scratch â€” [**demo.sst.dev**](https://demo.sst.dev)

![Demo App](screenshot.png)

We use React.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Cognito. This repo is a full-stack serverless app built with [SST](https://github.com/sst/sst).

- The `stacks/` directory defines our AWS infrastructure using AWS CDK.
- The `packages/functions` directory contains the Lambda functions that power the CRUD API.
- The `packages/frontend` directory contains the React app.

It's a single-page React app powered by a serverless CRUD API. We also cover how add user authentication, handle file uploads, and process credit card payments with Stripe.

### Usage

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sst/demo-notes-app

This project uses a secret that we are not checking in to the repo. Make sure to [create one before deploying](https://sst.dev/chapters/handling-secrets-in-sst.html).

```bash
$ pnpm sst secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY <YOUR STRIPE SECRET TEST KEY>
```

#### Developing Locally

```bash
$ pnpmx sst dev
```

Start the React local dev environment from the `packges/frontend/` dir.

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```
